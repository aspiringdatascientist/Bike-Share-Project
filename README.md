Bike sharing systems have been increasing in demand over the past two decades as a result of rapid advancements in technology. Healthy Ride
is a public bicycle sharing system that serves parts of Pittsburgh to fulfill the growing need for changes in mobility pattern. With 100
stations, the city has plans to add 75 more stations in 2019, including several electric bikes to help riders navigate Pittsburghâ€™s hilly
geography, located throughout the city. 


 Bike-sharing systems are used world-wide. Given that the system tends to be unbalanced, particularly  at peak demand hours,
 there are challenging analytical issues such as accurately predicting the demand.This project explores on predicting the total count
 of bikes rented during each hour covered by the Healthy Ride operated by Pittsburgh Bike Share.
